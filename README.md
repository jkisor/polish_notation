polish_notation
===============
This is an exercise using unit tests to drive the implementation of a polish notation calculator. 
This simple program utilizes a stack to parse a string containing polish notation, evaluates the equation and returns the result.

The usefulness of polish notation (Example: + 4 3 = 7) is that the order of operations is defined within the structure of prefix notation.
